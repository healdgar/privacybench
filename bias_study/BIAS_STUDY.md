# Bias Study Methodology and Advantages

This document outlines the methodology used to evaluate summarization bias in news articles and discusses the advantages of our approach. By leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) and a multi-dimensional bias framework, this study provides both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias in automated summaries.

## Overview

Our bias study involves two main stages:

1. **Summarization:** A source news article is summarized by one or more LLMs.
2. **Bias Evaluation:** The resulting summary is evaluated for bias against a predefined set of criteria by a judge model (which can be the same or a different LLM).

The entire process is automated and outputs results in JSON format for easy visualization and further analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Input Data

- **Source Article:** The original news article is stored along with its URL.
- **Summary Prompt:** A prompt instructing the model to generate a concise summary (e.g., 3-5 sentences) of the article.
- **Article URL:** Stored for reference and traceability.

### 2. Summarization

- **LLM Selection:** The study supports multiple summarization models (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `grok-2-latest`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`).
- **Prompt Design:** The prompt combines the source article and a summary prompt, ensuring that the summarizer has full context.
- **Output:** The summary is generated and stored along with metadata such as the summarizer model and timestamp.

### 3. Bias Evaluation

- **Bias Criteria:** We evaluate the summary against several bias dimensions, including:
  - **Factual Integrity & Completeness:** Evaluating if the summary accurately and comprehensively reflects the source article.
  - **Language Neutrality:** Checking for impartial and non-emotive language.
  - **Balance & Fairness:** Assessing whether multiple perspectives are represented.
  - **Ideological Biases:** Including political, economic, social, and other dimensions.
- **JSON Response Format:** Each judge model is instructed to return a JSON object with two keys:
  - **`rating_numeric`:** A single number between 1 and 10 (with 5 representing a neutral rating).
  - **`rating_commentary`:** A brief explanation of the rating.
- **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt explicitly instructs the model to output only valid JSON to ease parsing and ensure consistency.
- **Parsing and Storage:** The raw responses are cleaned (e.g., stripping markdown formatting) and parsed into structured JSON. These results are then saved alongside the summarization results.

### 4. Data Visualization & Analysis

- **Quantitative Metrics:** Average ratings, distributions, and other summary statistics for each bias criterion.
- **Visual Tools:** Bar charts, radar/spider charts, and box plots to compare bias across models and criteria.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Commentary from the JSON responses can be further analyzed via word clouds or text summarization to extract common themes.

## Advantages

### Scalability and Automation

- **Automated Pipeline:** The entire process—from summarization to bias evaluation—is automated. This enables processing large volumes of articles consistently and efficiently.
- **Reproducibility:** Storing results in JSON ensures that evaluations can be reviewed and re-analyzed, supporting reproducibility across studies.

### Multi-Dimensional Evaluation

- **Comprehensive Bias Metrics:** By evaluating several dimensions of bias (factual accuracy, language neutrality, ideological leanings, etc.), the approach provides a nuanced understanding of how different summaries may distort or faithfully represent source content.
- **Separation of Numeric and Qualitative Data:** Splitting the bias output into a numeric rating and commentary allows both statistical analysis and deeper qualitative insights.

### Flexibility and Adaptability

- **Model Agnostic:** The framework supports multiple LLMs for both summarization and bias evaluation, making it possible to compare outputs from different models.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Our method allows for iterative improvements. If a model's response does not strictly follow the JSON format, the prompt can be refined to improve consistency.
- **Extensibility:** Additional bias dimensions or new evaluation criteria can be added to adapt to evolving research needs.

### Enhanced Transparency

- **Traceability:** Storing the source article URL and summarization prompts alongside the results increases transparency and allows for auditability of the entire process.
- **Visualization:** The use of data visualization tools helps in quickly identifying patterns and potential issues in the summaries, supporting robust analysis and decision-making.

## Future Directions

- **Cross-Model Comparison:** Future work could involve comparing the performance and bias profiles across different summarization and judge models.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Incorporating human evaluators could help validate and calibrate the automated ratings.
- **Integration with Other Data Sources:** Linking bias evaluations with audience metrics or fact-checking databases may further refine the analysis.

## Conclusion

This bias study approach offers a powerful, scalable, and nuanced method for evaluating summarization bias. By combining advanced LLM capabilities with a structured evaluation framework, we can better understand and mitigate bias in automated news summarization, ultimately contributing to more balanced and accurate media reporting.
