F D C - M S A ,\nOctober\n16,\n2023P a g e1 5o f1 5\n\n \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 1 of 16 November 2023  \nonline   \n \nDATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM  \n \n(Revision November 2023 ) \n \n \nThis Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules, (“DPA”) forms part of the Main Services Agreement or other written or  \nelectronic agreement between SFDC and Customer for the purchase of online services (including associated SFDC offline or mobi le \ncomponents) from SFDC (identified either as “Services” or otherwise in the applicable agreement, and hereinafter defined as \n“Services”) (the “Agreement”) to reflect the Parties’ agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.  \n \nIn the course of pro viding the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, SFDC may Process Personal Data on behalf of \nCustomer and the Parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any Personal Data, each acting reasona bly \nand in good faith.  \nHOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA:  \n1. This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Schedules 1 and 2.  \n2. This DPA has been pre -signed on behalf of SFDC. Schedule 2, section 1 has been pre -signed by Salesforce, Inc. as the data \nimporter. Please note that  the contracting entity under the Agreement may be a different entity to Salesforce, Inc.  \n3. To complete this DPA, Customer must:  \na. Complete the information in the signature box and sign on page 8. \nb. Send the signed DPA to SFDC by email to dataprocessing addendum@salesforce.com indicating, if applicable, the \nCustomer’s Account Number (as set out on the applicable SFDC Order Form or invoice).  \n \nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement, this DPA will become legally binding upon receipt by SFDC of the \nvalidly completed DPA at this email address.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, signature of the DPA on page 8 shall be deemed to constitute signature and acceptance of the Stan dard \nContractual C lauses, including Schedule 2. Where Customer wishes to separately execute the Standard Contractual Clauses and its \nAppendix, Customer should also complete the information as the data exporter and sign on page 14 (Schedule 2).  \nHOW THIS DPA APPLIES  \nIf the C ustomer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the Agreement. \nIn such case, the SFDC entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed  an Order Form with SFDC or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement, but is \nnot itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order Form(s), and the  \nSFDC entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA. For the purposes of this DPA, any reference to Order Form \nherein shall include “Ordering Document” (as defined in the Agreement).  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not va lid and is not \nlegally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor an Agreement directly with SFDC, but is instea d a \ncustomer indirectly via an authorized reseller of Salesforce services, this DPA is not valid and is not legally binding. Such  entity \nshould contact the authorized reseller to discuss whether any amendment to its agreement with that reseller may be requ ired. \n \nDATA PROCESSING TERMS  \n1.

Data Protection Officer.  Members of the SFDC Group have appointed a da ta protection officer. The appointed person may \nbe reached at privacy@salesforce.com.  \n5. SUB -PROCESSORS  \n5.1. Appointment of Sub -processors. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) SFDC’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub -\nprocessors; and (b) SFDC and SFDC’s Affiliates respectively may engage third -party Sub -processors to provide the Services. \nSFDC or an SFDC Affiliate has entered into a written agreement with each Sub -processor containing, in substance, data \nprotection obligations no less protective than thos e in the Agreement with respect to the protection of Personal Data to the \nextent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Sub -processor.  \n5.2. Current List of Sub -processors and Notification of New Sub -processors. The current list of Sub -process ors engaged in \nProcessing Personal Data for the performance of each applicable Service, including a description of their processing \nactivities and countries of location, is listed under the Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation which can be found \non SFDC’s Trust and Compliance webpage  at https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/trust -and-compliance -\ndocumentation/  (“Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation”, also accessible via \nhttp://www.salesforce.com/company/leg al/agreements/  under the “Trust and Compliance Documentation” link ). Customer \nhereby consents to these Sub -processors, their locations and processing activities as it pertains to their Personal Data. The \nInfrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation conta ins a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub -processors \nfor each applicable Service, and if Customer subscribes, SFDC shall provide notification of a new Sub -processor(s) before \nauthorizing any new Sub -processor(s) to Process Personal Data to p rovide the applicable Services.  \n5.3. Objection Right for New Sub -processors. Customer may object to SFDC’s use of a new Sub -processor by notifying SFDC \npromptly in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of SFDC’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set  out in section \n5.2. If Customer objects to a new Sub -processor as permitted in the preceding sentence, SFDC will use reasonable efforts to \nmake available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s \nconfiguration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected -to new Sub -processor without \nunreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, \nwhich shall not exceed s ixty (60) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those \nServices which cannot be provided by SFDC without the use of the objected -to new Sub -processor by providing written \nnotice to SFDC. SFDC will refund Customer any  prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) \nfollowing the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such \ntermination on Customer.  \n5.4. Liability.  SFDC shall be liable for th e acts and omissions of its Sub -processors to the same extent SFDC would be liable if \nperforming the services of each Sub -processor directly under the terms of this DPA, unless otherwise set forth in the \nAgreement.  \n6. SECURITY, CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDIT  \n6.1. Contr ols for the Protection of Customer Data. SFDC shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures \nfor protection of the security (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or \nunlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data), confidentiality \nand integrity of Customer Data, as set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. SFDC regularly \nmonitors compliance with these meas ures. SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a \nsubscription term.  \n6.2. Third -Party Certifications and Audits. SFDC has obtained the third -party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, \nPrivacy and Architecture  Documentation for each applicable Service. Where SFDC has obtained ISO 27001 certifications \nand SSAE 18 Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 reports for a particular Service as described in the Documentation, \nSFDC agrees to maintain these certifications o r standards, or appropriate and comparable successors thereof, for the duration \nof the Agreement   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 5 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  6.3. Audit Program.  SFDC shall maintain an audit program to help ensure compliance with the obligations set out in this DPA \nand shall make available to Customer inf ormation to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in this DPA, \nincluding those obligations required by applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations, as set forth in this section 6.2.  \n6.3.1. Access to Third -Party Certifications and Audits I nformation. Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable \nintervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, SFDC shall:  \n(i) the make available to Customer (or Customer’s Third -Party Auditor - as defined below in section 6.2.4) information \nregarding SFDC’s compliance with the obligations set forth in this DPA in the form of a copy of SFDC’s then most \nrecent third -party audits or certifications set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Such \nthird -party audits or certifications may also be shared with Customer’s competent supervisory authority on its request;  \n(ii) provide Customer with a report and/or confirmation of SFDC's audits of third -party Sub -processors’ compliance with \nthe data protection cont rols set forth in this DPA and/or a report of third -party auditors’ audits of third party Sub -\nprocessors that have been provided by those third -party Sub -processors to SFDC, to the extent such reports or \nevidence may be shared with Customer (“Third -party S ub-processor Audit Reports”). Customer acknowledges that \n(i) Third -party Sub -processor Audit Reports shall be considered Confidential Information as well as confidential \ninformation of the third -party Sub -processor and (ii) certain third -party Sub -processo rs to SFDC may require \nCustomer to execute a non -disclosure agreement with them in order to view a Third -party Sub -processor Audit \nReport.  \n6.3.2. On -Site Audit . Customer can request an on -site audit of SFDC’s Processing activities covered by this DPA (“On -\nSite Audit”). An On -Site Audit may be conducted by Customer either itself or through a Third -Party Auditor (as defined \nbelow in section 6.3.4) selected by Customer when:  \n(i) the information available pursuant to section “Third -Party Certifications and Audits” is not sufficient to demonstrate \ncompliance with the obligations set out in this DPA and its Schedules;  \n(ii) Customer has received a notice from SFDC of a Customer Data Incident; or  \n(iii) such an audit is required by Data Protection Laws and Regula tions or by Customer’s competent supervisory authority.  \nAny On -Site Audits will be limited to Customer Data Processing and storage facilities operated by SFDC or any of SFDC’s \nAffiliates.  \n6.3.3. Reasonable Exercise of Rights . An On -Site Audit shall be con ducted by Customer or its Third -Party Auditor:  \n(i) acting reasonably, in good faith, and in a proportional manner, taking into account the nature and complexity of the \nServices used by Customer;  \n(ii) up to one time per year with at least three weeks’ advan ce written notice.

Before any On -Site Audit commences, \nCustomer and SFDC shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit and the reimbursement rate for \nwhich Customer shall be responsible. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources \nexpended by or on behalf of SFDC.

If SFDC receives a legally binding request to \naccess Personal Data from a Public Authority, SFDC shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify Customer \nincluding a summary of the nature of the request. To the extent SFD C is prohibited by law from providing such notification, \nSFDC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition to enable SFDC to communicate as \nmuch information as possible, as soon as possible.

SFDC shall pursue possibilities of \nappeal. When challenging a request, SFDC shall seek interim measures with a view to suspen ding the effects of the request \nuntil the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.

Preferably, subscriptions should not auto-renew without explicit consent. | 🟨 | Propose language to remove auto-renewal unless explicitly agreed upon before each renewal period. |\n| Term | \"This Agreement commences on the date Customer first accepts it and continues until all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been terminated.\" (Section 11.1) | The term is open-ended linked to the duration of subscriptions, which can be problematic without clear termination options. | 🟨 | Ensure proper exit mechanisms are in place or renegotiate for a fixed term. |\n| Termination | \"A party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon 30 days' written notice to the other party of a material breach...\" (Section 11.3) | The contract allows for termination for cause by either party, but there is no termination for convenience. | 🟨 | Seek to include a clause for termination for convenience by the Customer with a reasonable notice period. |\n| IP Ownership | \"SFDC acquires no right, title or interest from Customer or its licensors under this Agreement in or to any Customer Data...\" (Section 6.3) | Customer retains ownership of its data, which meets the requirement. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Confidentiality | \"Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data...\" (Section 7.1) | The contract adequately protects customer data as confidential information. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Limitation of Liability | \"IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY...

However, consider the impacts of limit levels. | 🟨 | Review the liability caps to ensure they are reasonable based on the level of risk. |\n| Indemnification | \"SFDC will defend Customer against any... claim alleging that any Purchased Service infringes...\" (Section 9.1) | SFDC provides indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Governing Law | \"Governing law is: California and controlling United States federal law.\" (Section 12.9) | The choice of California law aligns with common preferences. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Assignment | \"Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder... without the other party’s prior written consent...\" (Section 12.8) | The clause includes the option of assigning to an affiliate without consent, which aligns with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Artificial Intelligence | \"Customer will use the Services in accordance with... the Artificial Intelligence Acceptable Use Policy\" (Section 3.3) | There is no explicit language prohibiting training AI with the data provided. | 🟥 | Propose to add specific language prohibiting the use of customer data in training AI models. |\n| Warranties | \"SFDC warrants that... the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation...\" (Section 8.2) | SFDC provides some warranties about the functionality and security of their services, which is in line with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Warranty Disclaimer | \"EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...\" (Section 8.3) | The disclaimer excludes any implied warranties, common in contracts but requires careful scrutiny on coverage. | 🟨 | Ensure explicit warranties cover critical areas of service performance. |\n| Waiver | \"No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right... will constitute a waiver of that right.\" (Section 12.6) | This is a standard waiver clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Feedback | \"Customer grants to SFDC and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use... feedback.\" (Section 6.4) | SFDC claims broad rights to customer feedback, which could be concerning. | 🟨 | Consider limiting the extent of feedback use licensing. |\n| Force Majeure | \"Any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond SFDC’s reasonable control...\" (Section 2.1) | The force majeure clause appears reasonable and standard. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Severability | \"If any provision... is held ... to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void...\" (Section 12.7) | This is a standard severability clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Order of Precedence | \"The order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) this Agreement, and (3) the Documentation.\" (Section 12.3) | The clause clearly defines the hierarchy of documents, which is beneficial. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Unusual Terms | N/A | No standout unusual terms were identified beyond those already outlined. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n\n---\n\n### General Guidance\n- Ensure any requirement not already covered (like prohibition of AI training) is addressed through actionable clauses or addenda.\n- Propose amendments or clarifications on auto-renewal and the mutual limitation of liability to ensure they are in line with your requirements and risk tolerance.",

F D C - M S A ,\nOctober\n16,\n2023P a g e1 5o f1 5\n\n \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 1 of 16 November 2023  \nonline   \n \nDATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM  \n \n(Revision November 2023 ) \n \n \nThis Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules, (“DPA”) forms part of the Main Services Agreement or other written or  \nelectronic agreement between SFDC and Customer for the purchase of online services (including associated SFDC offline or mobi le \ncomponents) from SFDC (identified either as “Services” or otherwise in the applicable agreement, and hereinafter defined as \n“Services”) (the “Agreement”) to reflect the Parties’ agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.  \n \nIn the course of pro viding the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, SFDC may Process Personal Data on behalf of \nCustomer and the Parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any Personal Data, each acting reasona bly \nand in good faith.  \nHOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA:  \n1. This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Schedules 1 and 2.  \n2. This DPA has been pre -signed on behalf of SFDC. Schedule 2, section 1 has been pre -signed by Salesforce, Inc. as the data \nimporter. Please note that  the contracting entity under the Agreement may be a different entity to Salesforce, Inc.  \n3. To complete this DPA, Customer must:  \na. Complete the information in the signature box and sign on page 8. \nb. Send the signed DPA to SFDC by email to dataprocessing addendum@salesforce.com indicating, if applicable, the \nCustomer’s Account Number (as set out on the applicable SFDC Order Form or invoice).  \n \nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement, this DPA will become legally binding upon receipt by SFDC of the \nvalidly completed DPA at this email address.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, signature of the DPA on page 8 shall be deemed to constitute signature and acceptance of the Stan dard \nContractual C lauses, including Schedule 2. Where Customer wishes to separately execute the Standard Contractual Clauses and its \nAppendix, Customer should also complete the information as the data exporter and sign on page 14 (Schedule 2).  \nHOW THIS DPA APPLIES  \nIf the C ustomer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the Agreement. \nIn such case, the SFDC entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed  an Order Form with SFDC or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement, but is \nnot itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order Form(s), and the  \nSFDC entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA. For the purposes of this DPA, any reference to Order Form \nherein shall include “Ordering Document” (as defined in the Agreement).  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not va lid and is not \nlegally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor an Agreement directly with SFDC, but is instea d a \ncustomer indirectly via an authorized reseller of Salesforce services, this DPA is not valid and is not legally binding. Such  entity \nshould contact the authorized reseller to discuss whether any amendment to its agreement with that reseller may be requ ired. \n \nDATA PROCESSING TERMS  \n1. DEFINITIONS  \n“Affiliate”  means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the subject \nentity. “Control,” for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the \nvoting interests  of the subject entity.  \n \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 2 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  “Authorized Affiliate ” means any of Customer’s Affiliate(s) which (a) is subject to the data protection laws and regulations \nof the European Union, the European Economic Area and/or their member states, Switzerland and/or the United  Kingdom, \nand (b) is permitted to use the Services pursuant to the Agreement between Customer and SFDC, but has not signed its own \nOrder Form with SFDC.  \n“CCPA” means the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ.

However, consider the impacts of limit levels. | 🟨 | Review the liability caps to ensure they are reasonable based on the level of risk. |\n| Indemnification | \"SFDC will defend Customer against any... claim alleging that any Purchased Service infringes...\" (Section 9.1) | SFDC provides indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Governing Law | \"Governing law is: California and controlling United States federal law.\" (Section 12.9) | The choice of California law aligns with common preferences. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Assignment | \"Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder... without the other party’s prior written consent...\" (Section 12.8) | The clause includes the option of assigning to an affiliate without consent, which aligns with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Artificial Intelligence | \"Customer will use the Services in accordance with... the Artificial Intelligence Acceptable Use Policy\" (Section 3.3) | There is no explicit language prohibiting training AI with the data provided. | 🟥 | Propose to add specific language prohibiting the use of customer data in training AI models. |\n| Warranties | \"SFDC warrants that... the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation...\" (Section 8.2) | SFDC provides some warranties about the functionality and security of their services, which is in line with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Warranty Disclaimer | \"EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...\" (Section 8.3) | The disclaimer excludes any implied warranties, common in contracts but requires careful scrutiny on coverage. | 🟨 | Ensure explicit warranties cover critical areas of service performance. |\n| Waiver | \"No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right... will constitute a waiver of that right.\" (Section 12.6) | This is a standard waiver clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Feedback | \"Customer grants to SFDC and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use... feedback.\" (Section 6.4) | SFDC claims broad rights to customer feedback, which could be concerning. | 🟨 | Consider limiting the extent of feedback use licensing. |\n| Force Majeure | \"Any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond SFDC’s reasonable control...\" (Section 2.1) | The force majeure clause appears reasonable and standard. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Severability | \"If any provision... is held ... to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void...\" (Section 12.7) | This is a standard severability clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Order of Precedence | \"The order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) this Agreement, and (3) the Documentation.\" (Section 12.3) | The clause clearly defines the hierarchy of documents, which is beneficial. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Unusual Terms | N/A | No standout unusual terms were identified beyond those already outlined. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n\n---\n\n### General Guidance\n- Ensure any requirement not already covered (like prohibition of AI training) is addressed through actionable clauses or addenda.\n- Propose amendments or clarifications on auto-renewal and the mutual limitation of liability to ensure they are in line with your requirements and risk tolerance.",

F D C - M S A ,\nOctober\n16,\n2023P a g e1 5o f1 5\n\n \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 1 of 16 November 2023  \nonline   \n \nDATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM  \n \n(Revision November 2023 ) \n \n \nThis Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules, (“DPA”) forms part of the Main Services Agreement or other written or  \nelectronic agreement between SFDC and Customer for the purchase of online services (including associated SFDC offline or mobi le \ncomponents) from SFDC (identified either as “Services” or otherwise in the applicable agreement, and hereinafter defined as \n“Services”) (the “Agreement”) to reflect the Parties’ agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.  \n \nIn the course of pro viding the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, SFDC may Process Personal Data on behalf of \nCustomer and the Parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any Personal Data, each acting reasona bly \nand in good faith.  \nHOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA:  \n1. This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Schedules 1 and 2.  \n2. This DPA has been pre -signed on behalf of SFDC. Schedule 2, section 1 has been pre -signed by Salesforce, Inc. as the data \nimporter. Please note that  the contracting entity under the Agreement may be a different entity to Salesforce, Inc.  \n3. To complete this DPA, Customer must:  \na. Complete the information in the signature box and sign on page 8. \nb. Send the signed DPA to SFDC by email to dataprocessing addendum@salesforce.com indicating, if applicable, the \nCustomer’s Account Number (as set out on the applicable SFDC Order Form or invoice).  \n \nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement, this DPA will become legally binding upon receipt by SFDC of the \nvalidly completed DPA at this email address.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, signature of the DPA on page 8 shall be deemed to constitute signature and acceptance of the Stan dard \nContractual C lauses, including Schedule 2. Where Customer wishes to separately execute the Standard Contractual Clauses and its \nAppendix, Customer should also complete the information as the data exporter and sign on page 14 (Schedule 2).  \nHOW THIS DPA APPLIES  \nIf the C ustomer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the Agreement. \nIn such case, the SFDC entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed  an Order Form with SFDC or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement, but is \nnot itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order Form(s), and the  \nSFDC entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA. For the purposes of this DPA, any reference to Order Form \nherein shall include “Ordering Document” (as defined in the Agreement).  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not va lid and is not \nlegally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor an Agreement directly with SFDC, but is instea d a \ncustomer indirectly via an authorized reseller of Salesforce services, this DPA is not valid and is not legally binding. Such  entity \nshould contact the authorized reseller to discuss whether any amendment to its agreement with that reseller may be requ ired. \n \nDATA PROCESSING TERMS  \n1.

The current list of Sub -process ors engaged in \nProcessing Personal Data for the performance of each applicable Service, including a description of their processing \nactivities and countries of location, is listed under the Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation which can be found \non SFDC’s Trust and Compliance webpage  at https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/trust -and-compliance -\ndocumentation/  (“Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation”, also accessible via \nhttp://www.salesforce.com/company/leg al/agreements/  under the “Trust and Compliance Documentation” link ). Customer \nhereby consents to these Sub -processors, their locations and processing activities as it pertains to their Personal Data. The \nInfrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation conta ins a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub -processors \nfor each applicable Service, and if Customer subscribes, SFDC shall provide notification of a new Sub -processor(s) before \nauthorizing any new Sub -processor(s) to Process Personal Data to p rovide the applicable Services.  \n5.3. Objection Right for New Sub -processors. Customer may object to SFDC’s use of a new Sub -processor by notifying SFDC \npromptly in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of SFDC’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set  out in section \n5.2. If Customer objects to a new Sub -processor as permitted in the preceding sentence, SFDC will use reasonable efforts to \nmake available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s \nconfiguration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected -to new Sub -processor without \nunreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, \nwhich shall not exceed s ixty (60) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those \nServices which cannot be provided by SFDC without the use of the objected -to new Sub -processor by providing written \nnotice to SFDC. SFDC will refund Customer any  prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) \nfollowing the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such \ntermination on Customer.  \n5.4. Liability.  SFDC shall be liable for th e acts and omissions of its Sub -processors to the same extent SFDC would be liable if \nperforming the services of each Sub -processor directly under the terms of this DPA, unless otherwise set forth in the \nAgreement.  \n6. SECURITY, CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDIT  \n6.1. Contr ols for the Protection of Customer Data. SFDC shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures \nfor protection of the security (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or \nunlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data), confidentiality \nand integrity of Customer Data, as set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. SFDC regularly \nmonitors compliance with these meas ures. SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a \nsubscription term.  \n6.2. Third -Party Certifications and Audits. SFDC has obtained the third -party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, \nPrivacy and Architecture  Documentation for each applicable Service. Where SFDC has obtained ISO 27001 certifications \nand SSAE 18 Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 reports for a particular Service as described in the Documentation, \nSFDC agrees to maintain these certifications o r standards, or appropriate and comparable successors thereof, for the duration \nof the Agreement   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 5 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  6.3. Audit Program.  SFDC shall maintain an audit program to help ensure compliance with the obligations set out in this DPA \nand shall make available to Customer inf ormation to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in this DPA, \nincluding those obligations required by applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations, as set forth in this section 6.2.  \n6.3.1. Access to Third -Party Certifications and Audits I nformation. Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable \nintervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, SFDC shall:  \n(i) the make available to Customer (or Customer’s Third -Party Auditor - as defined below in section 6.2.4) information \nregarding SFDC’s compliance with the obligations set forth in this DPA in the form of a copy of SFDC’s then most \nrecent third -party audits or certifications set forth in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Such \nthird -party audits or certifications may also be shared with Customer’s competent supervisory authority on its request;  \n(ii) provide Customer with a report and/or confirmation of SFDC's audits of third -party Sub -processors’ compliance with \nthe data protection cont rols set forth in this DPA and/or a report of third -party auditors’ audits of third party Sub -\nprocessors that have been provided by those third -party Sub -processors to SFDC, to the extent such reports or \nevidence may be shared with Customer (“Third -party S ub-processor Audit Reports”). Customer acknowledges that \n(i) Third -party Sub -processor Audit Reports shall be considered Confidential Information as well as confidential \ninformation of the third -party Sub -processor and (ii) certain third -party Sub -processo rs to SFDC may require \nCustomer to execute a non -disclosure agreement with them in order to view a Third -party Sub -processor Audit \nReport.  \n6.3.2. On -Site Audit . Customer can request an on -site audit of SFDC’s Processing activities covered by this DPA (“On -\nSite Audit”). An On -Site Audit may be conducted by Customer either itself or through a Third -Party Auditor (as defined \nbelow in section 6.3.4) selected by Customer when:  \n(i) the information available pursuant to section “Third -Party Certifications and Audits” is not sufficient to demonstrate \ncompliance with the obligations set out in this DPA and its Schedules;  \n(ii) Customer has received a notice from SFDC of a Customer Data Incident; or  \n(iii) such an audit is required by Data Protection Laws and Regula tions or by Customer’s competent supervisory authority.  \nAny On -Site Audits will be limited to Customer Data Processing and storage facilities operated by SFDC or any of SFDC’s \nAffiliates.  \n6.3.3. Reasonable Exercise of Rights . An On -Site Audit shall be con ducted by Customer or its Third -Party Auditor:  \n(i) acting reasonably, in good faith, and in a proportional manner, taking into account the nature and complexity of the \nServices used by Customer;  \n(ii) up to one time per year with at least three weeks’ advan ce written notice. If an emergency justifies a shorter notice \nperiod, SFDC will use good faith efforts to accommodate the On -Site Audit request; and  \n(iii) during SFDC’s normal business hours, under reasonable duration and shall not unreasonably interfere w ith SFDC’s \nday-to-day operations.  \nCustomer acknowledges that SFDC operates a multi -tenant cloud environment. Before any On -Site Audit commences, \nCustomer and SFDC shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit and the reimbursement rate for \nwhich Customer shall be responsible. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources \nexpended by or on behalf of SFDC. SFDC shall have the right to reasonably adapt the scope of any On -Site Audit to avoid \nor mitigate  risks with respect to, and including, service levels, availability, and confidentiality of other SFDC customers’ \ninformation.  \n6.3.4. Third -Party Auditor . A Third -Party Auditor means a third -party independent contractor that is not a competitor of \nSFDC. An  On-Site Audit can be conducted through a Third Party Auditor if:  \n(i) prior to the On -Site Audit, the Third -Party Auditor enters into a non -disclosure agreement containing confidentiality \nprovisions no less protective than those set forth in the Agreement to protect SFDC’s proprietary information; and  \n(ii) the costs of the Third -Party Auditor are at Customer’s expense.  \n6.3.5. Findings . Customer must promptly provide SFDC with information regarding any non -compliance discovered during \nthe course of an On-Site Audit.  \n6.4. Data Protection Impact Assessment.  Upon Customer’s request, SFDC shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation \nand assistance needed to fulfill Customer’s obligation under Data Protection Laws and Regulations to carry out a data \nprotect ion impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have \naccess to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to SFDC.  \n7. CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION  \nSFDC maintains security incident management policies and procedures specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture \nDocumentation and shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful  \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 6 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  destruction, loss, alter ation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data, including Personal Data, transmitted, \nstored or otherwise Processed by SFDC or its Sub -processors of which SFDC becomes aware (a “Customer Data Incident”). \nSFDC shall make reasonable efforts to  identify the cause of such Customer Data Incident and take such steps as SFDC \ndeems necessary and reasonable to remediate the cause of such a Customer Data Incident to the extent the remediation is \nwithin SFDC’s reasonable control. The obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or \nCustomer’s Users.  \n8. GOVERNMENT ACCESS REQUESTS  \n8.1 SFDC requirements. As a Processor, SFDC shall maintain appropriate measures to protect Personal Data in accordance \nwith the requirements of Data Pr otection Laws and Regulations, including by implementing appropriate technical and \norganizational safeguards to protect Personal Data against any interference that goes beyond what is necessary in a \ndemocratic society to safeguard national security, defens e and public security. If SFDC receives a legally binding request to \naccess Personal Data from a Public Authority, SFDC shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify Customer \nincluding a summary of the nature of the request. To the extent SFD C is prohibited by law from providing such notification, \nSFDC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition to enable SFDC to communicate as \nmuch information as possible, as soon as possible. Further, SFDC shall challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it \nconcludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful. SFDC shall pursue possibilities of \nappeal. When challenging a request, SFDC shall seek interim measures with a view to suspen ding the effects of the request \nuntil the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the Personal Data requested until req uired \nto do so under the applicable procedural rules. SFDC agrees it will provide the minimum amoun t of information permissible \nwhen responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. SFDC shall promptly notify \nCustomer if SFDC becomes aware of any direct access by a Public Authority to Personal Data and provide  information \navailable to SFDC in this respect, to the extent permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not require \nSFDC to pursue action or inaction that could result in civil or criminal penalty for SFDC such as contempt of court. SFDC  \ncertifies that SFDC (1) has not purposefully created back doors or similar programming for the purpose of allowing access \nto the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; (2) has not purposefully created or changed its business \nprocesses in a  manner that facilitates access to the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; and (3) at the \nEffective Date is not currently aware of any national law or government policy requiring SFDC to create or maintain back \ndoors, or to facilitate ac cess to the Services and/or Personal Data, to keep in its possession any encryption keys or to hand -\nover the encryption key to any third party.  \n \n8.2 Sub -processors requirements . SFDC shall ensure that Sub -processors involved in the Processing of Personal D ata are \nsubject to the relevant commitments regarding Government Access Requests in the Standard Contractual Clauses and \nSalesforce Processor BCR.  \n9. RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA  \nSFDC shall return Customer Data to Customer and, to the extent allowed b y applicable law, delete Customer Data in \naccordance with the procedures and timeframes specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Until \nCustomer Data is deleted or returned, SFDC shall continue to comply with this DPA and its Sched ules. \n10. AUTHORIZED AFFILIATES  \n10.1. Contractual Relationship. The parties acknowledge and agree that, by executing the Agreement, Customer enters into this \nDPA on behalf of itself and, as applicable, in the name and on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates, thereby establishing a \nseparate DPA between SFDC and each such Authorized Affiliate subject to the provisions of the Agreement and this section \n10 and section 11. Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this DPA and, to the extent \napplicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the \nAgreement, and is a party only to this DPA. All access to and use of the Services and Content by Authorized Affiliates must \ncomply with th e terms and conditions of the Agreement and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by \nan Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.  \n10.2.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \nEach party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA, an d all \nDPAs between Authorized Affiliates an d SFDC, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to \nthe ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the Agreement, and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means t he \naggregate liability of that party and al l of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, SFDC’s and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from Customer and all of its Authorized  \nAffiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and all DPAs shall apply in the aggregate for all claims under both the \nAgreement and all DPAs established under the Agreement, including by Customer and all Authorized Affiliates, and, in \nparticular, shall not be understood to apply individually and severally to Custo mer and/or to any Authorized Affiliate that is \na contractual party to any such DPA.  \n12.

If SFDC reasonably believes that any existing or future enacted \nor enforceable laws and pract ices in the third country of destination applicable to its Processing of the Personal Data (\"Local \nLaws\") prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA, it shall promptly notify Customer. In such a case, SFDC \nshall use reasonable efforts to mak e available to the affected Customer a change in the Services or recommend a \ncommercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to facilitate compliance with the Local \nLaws without unreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change promptly, Customer may \nterminate the applicable Order Form(s) and suspend the transfer of Personal Data in respect only to those Services which \ncannot be provided by SFDC in accordance with the Local Laws by providing w ritten notice in accordance with the “Notices” \nsection of the Agreement. Customer shall receive a refund of any prepaid fees for the period following the effective date of \ntermination for such terminated Services.   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 8 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  13.

F D C - M S A ,\nOctober\n16,\n2023P a g e1 5o f1 5\n\n \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 1 of 16 November 2023  \nonline   \n \nDATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM  \n \n(Revision November 2023 ) \n \n \nThis Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules, (“DPA”) forms part of the Main Services Agreement or other written or  \nelectronic agreement between SFDC and Customer for the purchase of online services (including associated SFDC offline or mobi le \ncomponents) from SFDC (identified either as “Services” or otherwise in the applicable agreement, and hereinafter defined as \n“Services”) (the “Agreement”) to reflect the Parties’ agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.  \n \nIn the course of pro viding the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, SFDC may Process Personal Data on behalf of \nCustomer and the Parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any Personal Data, each acting reasona bly \nand in good faith.  \nHOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA:  \n1. This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Schedules 1 and 2.  \n2. This DPA has been pre -signed on behalf of SFDC. Schedule 2, section 1 has been pre -signed by Salesforce, Inc. as the data \nimporter. Please note that  the contracting entity under the Agreement may be a different entity to Salesforce, Inc.  \n3. To complete this DPA, Customer must:  \na. Complete the information in the signature box and sign on page 8. \nb. Send the signed DPA to SFDC by email to dataprocessing addendum@salesforce.com indicating, if applicable, the \nCustomer’s Account Number (as set out on the applicable SFDC Order Form or invoice).  \n \nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement, this DPA will become legally binding upon receipt by SFDC of the \nvalidly completed DPA at this email address.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, signature of the DPA on page 8 shall be deemed to constitute signature and acceptance of the Stan dard \nContractual C lauses, including Schedule 2. Where Customer wishes to separately execute the Standard Contractual Clauses and its \nAppendix, Customer should also complete the information as the data exporter and sign on page 14 (Schedule 2).  \nHOW THIS DPA APPLIES  \nIf the C ustomer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the Agreement. \nIn such case, the SFDC entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed  an Order Form with SFDC or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement, but is \nnot itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order Form(s), and the  \nSFDC entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA. For the purposes of this DPA, any reference to Order Form \nherein shall include “Ordering Document” (as defined in the Agreement).  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not va lid and is not \nlegally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor an Agreement directly with SFDC, but is instea d a \ncustomer indirectly via an authorized reseller of Salesforce services, this DPA is not valid and is not legally binding. Such  entity \nshould contact the authorized reseller to discuss whether any amendment to its agreement with that reseller may be requ ired. \n \nDATA PROCESSING TERMS  \n1.

Current List of Sub -processors and Notification of New Sub -processors. The current list of Sub -process ors engaged in \nProcessing Personal Data for the performance of each applicable Service, including a description of their processing \nactivities and countries of location, is listed under the Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation which can be found \non SFDC’s Trust and Compliance webpage  at https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/trust -and-compliance -\ndocumentation/  (“Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation”, also accessible via \nhttp://www.salesforce.com/company/leg al/agreements/  under the “Trust and Compliance Documentation” link ). Customer \nhereby consents to these Sub -processors, their locations and processing activities as it pertains to their Personal Data. The \nInfrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation conta ins a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub -processors \nfor each applicable Service, and if Customer subscribes, SFDC shall provide notification of a new Sub -processor(s) before \nauthorizing any new Sub -processor(s) to Process Personal Data to p rovide the applicable Services.  \n5.3.

Customer may object to SFDC’s use of a new Sub -processor by notifying SFDC \npromptly in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of SFDC’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set  out in section \n5.2. If Customer objects to a new Sub -processor as permitted in the preceding sentence, SFDC will use reasonable efforts to \nmake available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s \nconfiguration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected -to new Sub -processor without \nunreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, \nwhich shall not exceed s ixty (60) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those \nServices which cannot be provided by SFDC without the use of the objected -to new Sub -processor by providing written \nnotice to SFDC. SFDC will refund Customer any  prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) \nfollowing the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such \ntermination on Customer.  \n5.4. Liability.  SFDC shall be liable for th e acts and omissions of its Sub -processors to the same extent SFDC would be liable if \nperforming the services of each Sub -processor directly under the terms of this DPA, unless otherwise set forth in the \nAgreement.  \n6.

SFDC regularly \nmonitors compliance with these meas ures. SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a \nsubscription term.  \n6.2. Third -Party Certifications and Audits. SFDC has obtained the third -party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, \nPrivacy and Architecture  Documentation for each applicable Service. Where SFDC has obtained ISO 27001 certifications \nand SSAE 18 Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 reports for a particular Service as described in the Documentation, \nSFDC agrees to maintain these certifications o r standards, or appropriate and comparable successors thereof, for the duration \nof the Agreement   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 5 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  6.3.

Such \nthird -party audits or certifications may also be shared with Customer’s competent supervisory authority on its request;  \n(ii) provide Customer with a report and/or confirmation of SFDC's audits of third -party Sub -processors’ compliance with \nthe data protection cont rols set forth in this DPA and/or a report of third -party auditors’ audits of third party Sub -\nprocessors that have been provided by those third -party Sub -processors to SFDC, to the extent such reports or \nevidence may be shared with Customer (“Third -party S ub-processor Audit Reports”). Customer acknowledges that \n(i) Third -party Sub -processor Audit Reports shall be considered Confidential Information as well as confidential \ninformation of the third -party Sub -processor and (ii) certain third -party Sub -processo rs to SFDC may require \nCustomer to execute a non -disclosure agreement with them in order to view a Third -party Sub -processor Audit \nReport.  \n6.3.2. On -Site Audit . Customer can request an on -site audit of SFDC’s Processing activities covered by this DPA (“On -\nSite Audit”). An On -Site Audit may be conducted by Customer either itself or through a Third -Party Auditor (as defined \nbelow in section 6.3.4) selected by Customer when:  \n(i) the information available pursuant to section “Third -Party Certifications and Audits” is not sufficient to demonstrate \ncompliance with the obligations set out in this DPA and its Schedules;  \n(ii) Customer has received a notice from SFDC of a Customer Data Incident; or  \n(iii) such an audit is required by Data Protection Laws and Regula tions or by Customer’s competent supervisory authority.  \nAny On -Site Audits will be limited to Customer Data Processing and storage facilities operated by SFDC or any of SFDC’s \nAffiliates.  \n6.3.3. Reasonable Exercise of Rights . An On -Site Audit shall be con ducted by Customer or its Third -Party Auditor:  \n(i) acting reasonably, in good faith, and in a proportional manner, taking into account the nature and complexity of the \nServices used by Customer;  \n(ii) up to one time per year with at least three weeks’ advan ce written notice. If an emergency justifies a shorter notice \nperiod, SFDC will use good faith efforts to accommodate the On -Site Audit request; and  \n(iii) during SFDC’s normal business hours, under reasonable duration and shall not unreasonably interfere w ith SFDC’s \nday-to-day operations.  \nCustomer acknowledges that SFDC operates a multi -tenant cloud environment. Before any On -Site Audit commences, \nCustomer and SFDC shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit and the reimbursement rate for \nwhich Customer shall be responsible. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources \nexpended by or on behalf of SFDC. SFDC shall have the right to reasonably adapt the scope of any On -Site Audit to avoid \nor mitigate  risks with respect to, and including, service levels, availability, and confidentiality of other SFDC customers’ \ninformation.  \n6.3.4. Third -Party Auditor . A Third -Party Auditor means a third -party independent contractor that is not a competitor of \nSFDC. An  On-Site Audit can be conducted through a Third Party Auditor if:  \n(i) prior to the On -Site Audit, the Third -Party Auditor enters into a non -disclosure agreement containing confidentiality \nprovisions no less protective than those set forth in the Agreement to protect SFDC’s proprietary information; and  \n(ii) the costs of the Third -Party Auditor are at Customer’s expense.  \n6.3.5. Findings . Customer must promptly provide SFDC with information regarding any non -compliance discovered during \nthe course of an On-Site Audit.  \n6.4. Data Protection Impact Assessment.  Upon Customer’s request, SFDC shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation \nand assistance needed to fulfill Customer’s obligation under Data Protection Laws and Regulations to carry out a data \nprotect ion impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have \naccess to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to SFDC.  \n7. CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION  \nSFDC maintains security incident management policies and procedures specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture \nDocumentation and shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful  \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 6 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  destruction, loss, alter ation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data, including Personal Data, transmitted, \nstored or otherwise Processed by SFDC or its Sub -processors of which SFDC becomes aware (a “Customer Data Incident”). \nSFDC shall make reasonable efforts to  identify the cause of such Customer Data Incident and take such steps as SFDC \ndeems necessary and reasonable to remediate the cause of such a Customer Data Incident to the extent the remediation is \nwithin SFDC’s reasonable control. The obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or \nCustomer’s Users.  \n8. GOVERNMENT ACCESS REQUESTS  \n8.1 SFDC requirements. As a Processor, SFDC shall maintain appropriate measures to protect Personal Data in accordance \nwith the requirements of Data Pr otection Laws and Regulations, including by implementing appropriate technical and \norganizational safeguards to protect Personal Data against any interference that goes beyond what is necessary in a \ndemocratic society to safeguard national security, defens e and public security. If SFDC receives a legally binding request to \naccess Personal Data from a Public Authority, SFDC shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify Customer \nincluding a summary of the nature of the request. To the extent SFD C is prohibited by law from providing such notification, \nSFDC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition to enable SFDC to communicate as \nmuch information as possible, as soon as possible. Further, SFDC shall challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it \nconcludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful. SFDC shall pursue possibilities of \nappeal. When challenging a request, SFDC shall seek interim measures with a view to suspen ding the effects of the request \nuntil the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the Personal Data requested until req uired \nto do so under the applicable procedural rules. SFDC agrees it will provide the minimum amoun t of information permissible \nwhen responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. SFDC shall promptly notify \nCustomer if SFDC becomes aware of any direct access by a Public Authority to Personal Data and provide  information \navailable to SFDC in this respect, to the extent permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not require \nSFDC to pursue action or inaction that could result in civil or criminal penalty for SFDC such as contempt of court. SFDC  \ncertifies that SFDC (1) has not purposefully created back doors or similar programming for the purpose of allowing access \nto the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; (2) has not purposefully created or changed its business \nprocesses in a  manner that facilitates access to the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; and (3) at the \nEffective Date is not currently aware of any national law or government policy requiring SFDC to create or maintain back \ndoors, or to facilitate ac cess to the Services and/or Personal Data, to keep in its possession any encryption keys or to hand -\nover the encryption key to any third party.  \n \n8.2 Sub -processors requirements . SFDC shall ensure that Sub -processors involved in the Processing of Personal D ata are \nsubject to the relevant commitments regarding Government Access Requests in the Standard Contractual Clauses and \nSalesforce Processor BCR.  \n9. RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA  \nSFDC shall return Customer Data to Customer and, to the extent allowed b y applicable law, delete Customer Data in \naccordance with the procedures and timeframes specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Until \nCustomer Data is deleted or returned, SFDC shall continue to comply with this DPA and its Sched ules. \n10. AUTHORIZED AFFILIATES  \n10.1. Contractual Relationship. The parties acknowledge and agree that, by executing the Agreement, Customer enters into this \nDPA on behalf of itself and, as applicable, in the name and on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates, thereby establishing a \nseparate DPA between SFDC and each such Authorized Affiliate subject to the provisions of the Agreement and this section \n10 and section 11. Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this DPA and, to the extent \napplicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the \nAgreement, and is a party only to this DPA. All access to and use of the Services and Content by Authorized Affiliates must \ncomply with th e terms and conditions of the Agreement and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by \nan Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.  \n10.2. Communication.

(SFDC) and Customer.\n- **Effective Date:** Date of the Customer's acceptance of this Agreement.\n- **Duration:** Commences on the Effective Date and continues until all subscriptions have expired or been terminated.\n\n---\n\n### Contract Criteria\n\n| Provision | Contract Quote | Analysis | Action |\n|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|\n| Payment Terms | \"Invoiced fees are due net 30 days from the invoice date.\" (Section 5.2) | The contract meets the requirement for net 30 payment terms. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Auto-Renewal | \"Unless either party gives the other written notice (email acceptable) at least 30 days before the end of the relevant subscription term, subscriptions will automatically renew.\" (Section 11.2) | The contract includes an auto-renewal clause. Preferably, subscriptions should not auto-renew without explicit consent. | 🟨 | Propose language to remove auto-renewal unless explicitly agreed upon before each renewal period. |\n| Term | \"This Agreement commences on the date Customer first accepts it and continues until all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been terminated.\" (Section 11.1) | The term is open-ended linked to the duration of subscriptions, which can be problematic without clear termination options. | 🟨 | Ensure proper exit mechanisms are in place or renegotiate for a fixed term. |\n| Termination | \"A party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon 30 days' written notice to the other party of a material breach...\" (Section 11.3) | The contract allows for termination for cause by either party, but there is no termination for convenience. | 🟨 | Seek to include a clause for termination for convenience by the Customer with a reasonable notice period. |\n| IP Ownership | \"SFDC acquires no right, title or interest from Customer or its licensors under this Agreement in or to any Customer Data...\" (Section 6.3) | Customer retains ownership of its data, which meets the requirement. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Confidentiality | \"Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data...\" (Section 7.1) | The contract adequately protects customer data as confidential information. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Limitation of Liability | \"IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY... EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER...\" (Section 10.1) | There is a mutual limitation of liability, which is standard. However, consider the impacts of limit levels. | 🟨 | Review the liability caps to ensure they are reasonable based on the level of risk. |\n| Indemnification | \"SFDC will defend Customer against any... claim alleging that any Purchased Service infringes...\" (Section 9.1) | SFDC provides indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Governing Law | \"Governing law is: California and controlling United States federal law.\" (Section 12.9) | The choice of California law aligns with common preferences. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Assignment | \"Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder... without the other party’s prior written consent...\" (Section 12.8) | The clause includes the option of assigning to an affiliate without consent, which aligns with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Artificial Intelligence | \"Customer will use the Services in accordance with... the Artificial Intelligence Acceptable Use Policy\" (Section 3.3) | There is no explicit language prohibiting training AI with the data provided. | 🟥 | Propose to add specific language prohibiting the use of customer data in training AI models. |\n| Warranties | \"SFDC warrants that... the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation...\" (Section 8.2) | SFDC provides some warranties about the functionality and security of their services, which is in line with standard practice. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Warranty Disclaimer | \"EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...\" (Section 8.3) | The disclaimer excludes any implied warranties, common in contracts but requires careful scrutiny on coverage. | 🟨 | Ensure explicit warranties cover critical areas of service performance. |\n| Waiver | \"No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right... will constitute a waiver of that right.\" (Section 12.6) | This is a standard waiver clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Feedback | \"Customer grants to SFDC and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use... feedback.\" (Section 6.4) | SFDC claims broad rights to customer feedback, which could be concerning. | 🟨 | Consider limiting the extent of feedback use licensing. |\n| Force Majeure | \"Any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond SFDC’s reasonable control...\" (Section 2.1) | The force majeure clause appears reasonable and standard. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Severability | \"If any provision... is held ... to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void...\" (Section 12.7) | This is a standard severability clause. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Order of Precedence | \"The order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) this Agreement, and (3) the Documentation.\" (Section 12.3) | The clause clearly defines the hierarchy of documents, which is beneficial. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n| Unusual Terms | N/A | No standout unusual terms were identified beyond those already outlined. | 🟩 | No action needed. |\n\n---\n\n### General Guidance\n- Ensure any requirement not already covered (like prohibition of AI training) is addressed through actionable clauses or addenda.\n- Propose amendments or clarifications on auto-renewal and the mutual limitation of liability to ensure they are in line with your requirements and risk tolerance.",

\n \n \nThis Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules, (“DPA”) forms part of the Main Services Agreement or other written or  \nelectronic agreement between SFDC and Customer for the purchase of online services (including associated SFDC offline or mobi le \ncomponents) from SFDC (identified either as “Services” or otherwise in the applicable agreement, and hereinafter defined as \n“Services”) (the “Agreement”) to reflect the Parties’ agreement with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.  \n \nIn the course of pro viding the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, SFDC may Process Personal Data on behalf of \nCustomer and the Parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any Personal Data, each acting reasona bly \nand in good faith.  \nHOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA:  \n1. This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Schedules 1 and 2.  \n2. This DPA has been pre -signed on behalf of SFDC. Schedule 2, section 1 has been pre -signed by Salesforce, Inc. as the data \nimporter. Please note that  the contracting entity under the Agreement may be a different entity to Salesforce, Inc.  \n3. To complete this DPA, Customer must:  \na. Complete the information in the signature box and sign on page 8. \nb. Send the signed DPA to SFDC by email to dataprocessing addendum@salesforce.com indicating, if applicable, the \nCustomer’s Account Number (as set out on the applicable SFDC Order Form or invoice).  \n \nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement, this DPA will become legally binding upon receipt by SFDC of the \nvalidly completed DPA at this email address.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, signature of the DPA on page 8 shall be deemed to constitute signature and acceptance of the Stan dard \nContractual C lauses, including Schedule 2. Where Customer wishes to separately execute the Standard Contractual Clauses and its \nAppendix, Customer should also complete the information as the data exporter and sign on page 14 (Schedule 2).  \nHOW THIS DPA APPLIES  \nIf the C ustomer entity signing this DPA is a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to and forms part of the Agreement. \nIn such case, the SFDC entity that is party to the Agreement is party to this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA has executed  an Order Form with SFDC or its Affiliate pursuant to the Agreement, but is \nnot itself a party to the Agreement, this DPA is an addendum to that Order Form and applicable renewal Order Form(s), and the  \nSFDC entity that is party to such Order Form is party to this DPA. For the purposes of this DPA, any reference to Order Form \nherein shall include “Ordering Document” (as defined in the Agreement).  \nIf the Customer entity signing this DPA is neither a party to an Order Form nor the Agreement, this DPA is not va lid and is not \nlegally binding. Such entity should request that the Customer entity who is a party to the Agreement executes this DPA.  \nIf the Customer entity signing the DPA is not a party to an Order Form nor an Agreement directly with SFDC, but is instea d a \ncustomer indirectly via an authorized reseller of Salesforce services, this DPA is not valid and is not legally binding. Such  entity \nshould contact the authorized reseller to discuss whether any amendment to its agreement with that reseller may be requ ired. \n \nDATA PROCESSING TERMS  \n1.

Current List of Sub -processors and Notification of New Sub -processors. The current list of Sub -process ors engaged in \nProcessing Personal Data for the performance of each applicable Service, including a description of their processing \nactivities and countries of location, is listed under the Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation which can be found \non SFDC’s Trust and Compliance webpage  at https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/trust -and-compliance -\ndocumentation/  (“Infrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation”, also accessible via \nhttp://www.salesforce.com/company/leg al/agreements/  under the “Trust and Compliance Documentation” link ). Customer \nhereby consents to these Sub -processors, their locations and processing activities as it pertains to their Personal Data. The \nInfrastructure and Sub -processor Documentation conta ins a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub -processors \nfor each applicable Service, and if Customer subscribes, SFDC shall provide notification of a new Sub -processor(s) before \nauthorizing any new Sub -processor(s) to Process Personal Data to p rovide the applicable Services.  \n5.3. Objection Right for New Sub -processors. Customer may object to SFDC’s use of a new Sub -processor by notifying SFDC \npromptly in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of SFDC’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set  out in section \n5.2. If Customer objects to a new Sub -processor as permitted in the preceding sentence, SFDC will use reasonable efforts to \nmake available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s \nconfiguration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected -to new Sub -processor without \nunreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, \nwhich shall not exceed s ixty (60) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those \nServices which cannot be provided by SFDC without the use of the objected -to new Sub -processor by providing written \nnotice to SFDC. SFDC will refund Customer any  prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) \nfollowing the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such \ntermination on Customer.  \n5.4. Liability.  SFDC shall be liable for th e acts and omissions of its Sub -processors to the same extent SFDC would be liable if \nperforming the services of each Sub -processor directly under the terms of this DPA, unless otherwise set forth in the \nAgreement.  \n6. SECURITY, CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDIT  \n6.1. Contr ols for the Protection of Customer Data.

SFDC regularly \nmonitors compliance with these meas ures. SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a \nsubscription term.  \n6.2. Third -Party Certifications and Audits. SFDC has obtained the third -party certifications and audits set forth in the Security, \nPrivacy and Architecture  Documentation for each applicable Service. Where SFDC has obtained ISO 27001 certifications \nand SSAE 18 Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 reports for a particular Service as described in the Documentation, \nSFDC agrees to maintain these certifications o r standards, or appropriate and comparable successors thereof, for the duration \nof the Agreement   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 5 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  6.3.

Such \nthird -party audits or certifications may also be shared with Customer’s competent supervisory authority on its request;  \n(ii) provide Customer with a report and/or confirmation of SFDC's audits of third -party Sub -processors’ compliance with \nthe data protection cont rols set forth in this DPA and/or a report of third -party auditors’ audits of third party Sub -\nprocessors that have been provided by those third -party Sub -processors to SFDC, to the extent such reports or \nevidence may be shared with Customer (“Third -party S ub-processor Audit Reports”). Customer acknowledges that \n(i) Third -party Sub -processor Audit Reports shall be considered Confidential Information as well as confidential \ninformation of the third -party Sub -processor and (ii) certain third -party Sub -processo rs to SFDC may require \nCustomer to execute a non -disclosure agreement with them in order to view a Third -party Sub -processor Audit \nReport.  \n6.3.2. On -Site Audit . Customer can request an on -site audit of SFDC’s Processing activities covered by this DPA (“On -\nSite Audit”). An On -Site Audit may be conducted by Customer either itself or through a Third -Party Auditor (as defined \nbelow in section 6.3.4) selected by Customer when:  \n(i) the information available pursuant to section “Third -Party Certifications and Audits” is not sufficient to demonstrate \ncompliance with the obligations set out in this DPA and its Schedules;  \n(ii) Customer has received a notice from SFDC of a Customer Data Incident; or  \n(iii) such an audit is required by Data Protection Laws and Regula tions or by Customer’s competent supervisory authority.  \nAny On -Site Audits will be limited to Customer Data Processing and storage facilities operated by SFDC or any of SFDC’s \nAffiliates.  \n6.3.3. Reasonable Exercise of Rights . An On -Site Audit shall be con ducted by Customer or its Third -Party Auditor:  \n(i) acting reasonably, in good faith, and in a proportional manner, taking into account the nature and complexity of the \nServices used by Customer;  \n(ii) up to one time per year with at least three weeks’ advan ce written notice. If an emergency justifies a shorter notice \nperiod, SFDC will use good faith efforts to accommodate the On -Site Audit request; and  \n(iii) during SFDC’s normal business hours, under reasonable duration and shall not unreasonably interfere w ith SFDC’s \nday-to-day operations.  \nCustomer acknowledges that SFDC operates a multi -tenant cloud environment. Before any On -Site Audit commences, \nCustomer and SFDC shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit and the reimbursement rate for \nwhich Customer shall be responsible. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources \nexpended by or on behalf of SFDC. SFDC shall have the right to reasonably adapt the scope of any On -Site Audit to avoid \nor mitigate  risks with respect to, and including, service levels, availability, and confidentiality of other SFDC customers’ \ninformation.  \n6.3.4. Third -Party Auditor . A Third -Party Auditor means a third -party independent contractor that is not a competitor of \nSFDC. An  On-Site Audit can be conducted through a Third Party Auditor if:  \n(i) prior to the On -Site Audit, the Third -Party Auditor enters into a non -disclosure agreement containing confidentiality \nprovisions no less protective than those set forth in the Agreement to protect SFDC’s proprietary information; and  \n(ii) the costs of the Third -Party Auditor are at Customer’s expense.  \n6.3.5. Findings . Customer must promptly provide SFDC with information regarding any non -compliance discovered during \nthe course of an On-Site Audit.  \n6.4. Data Protection Impact Assessment.  Upon Customer’s request, SFDC shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation \nand assistance needed to fulfill Customer’s obligation under Data Protection Laws and Regulations to carry out a data \nprotect ion impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have \naccess to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to SFDC.  \n7. CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION  \nSFDC maintains security incident management policies and procedures specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture \nDocumentation and shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful  \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 6 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  destruction, loss, alter ation, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data, including Personal Data, transmitted, \nstored or otherwise Processed by SFDC or its Sub -processors of which SFDC becomes aware (a “Customer Data Incident”). \nSFDC shall make reasonable efforts to  identify the cause of such Customer Data Incident and take such steps as SFDC \ndeems necessary and reasonable to remediate the cause of such a Customer Data Incident to the extent the remediation is \nwithin SFDC’s reasonable control. The obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or \nCustomer’s Users.  \n8. GOVERNMENT ACCESS REQUESTS  \n8.1 SFDC requirements. As a Processor, SFDC shall maintain appropriate measures to protect Personal Data in accordance \nwith the requirements of Data Pr otection Laws and Regulations, including by implementing appropriate technical and \norganizational safeguards to protect Personal Data against any interference that goes beyond what is necessary in a \ndemocratic society to safeguard national security, defens e and public security. If SFDC receives a legally binding request to \naccess Personal Data from a Public Authority, SFDC shall, unless otherwise legally prohibited, promptly notify Customer \nincluding a summary of the nature of the request. To the extent SFD C is prohibited by law from providing such notification, \nSFDC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition to enable SFDC to communicate as \nmuch information as possible, as soon as possible. Further, SFDC shall challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it \nconcludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful. SFDC shall pursue possibilities of \nappeal. When challenging a request, SFDC shall seek interim measures with a view to suspen ding the effects of the request \nuntil the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the Personal Data requested until req uired \nto do so under the applicable procedural rules. SFDC agrees it will provide the minimum amoun t of information permissible \nwhen responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. SFDC shall promptly notify \nCustomer if SFDC becomes aware of any direct access by a Public Authority to Personal Data and provide  information \navailable to SFDC in this respect, to the extent permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not require \nSFDC to pursue action or inaction that could result in civil or criminal penalty for SFDC such as contempt of court. SFDC  \ncertifies that SFDC (1) has not purposefully created back doors or similar programming for the purpose of allowing access \nto the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; (2) has not purposefully created or changed its business \nprocesses in a  manner that facilitates access to the Services and/or Personal Data by any Public Authority; and (3) at the \nEffective Date is not currently aware of any national law or government policy requiring SFDC to create or maintain back \ndoors, or to facilitate ac cess to the Services and/or Personal Data, to keep in its possession any encryption keys or to hand -\nover the encryption key to any third party.  \n \n8.2 Sub -processors requirements . SFDC shall ensure that Sub -processors involved in the Processing of Personal D ata are \nsubject to the relevant commitments regarding Government Access Requests in the Standard Contractual Clauses and \nSalesforce Processor BCR.  \n9.

Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this DPA and, to the extent \napplicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the \nAgreement, and is a party only to this DPA. All access to and use of the Services and Content by Authorized Affiliates must \ncomply with th e terms and conditions of the Agreement and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by \nan Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.  \n10.2.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \nEach party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA, an d all \nDPAs between Authorized Affiliates an d SFDC, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to \nthe ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the Agreement, and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means t he \naggregate liability of that party and al l of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together.  \nFor the avoidance of doubt, SFDC’s and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from Customer and all of its Authorized  \nAffiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and all DPAs shall apply in the aggregate for all claims under both the \nAgreement and all DPAs established under the Agreement, including by Customer and all Authorized Affiliates, and, in \nparticular, shall not be understood to apply individually and severally to Custo mer and/or to any Authorized Affiliate that is \na contractual party to any such DPA.  \n12.

If SFDC reasonably believes that any existing or future enacted \nor enforceable laws and pract ices in the third country of destination applicable to its Processing of the Personal Data (\"Local \nLaws\") prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA, it shall promptly notify Customer. In such a case, SFDC \nshall use reasonable efforts to mak e available to the affected Customer a change in the Services or recommend a \ncommercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to facilitate compliance with the Local \nLaws without unreasonably burdening Customer. If SFDC is unable to make available such change promptly, Customer may \nterminate the applicable Order Form(s) and suspend the transfer of Personal Data in respect only to those Services which \ncannot be provided by SFDC in accordance with the Local Laws by providing w ritten notice in accordance with the “Notices” \nsection of the Agreement. Customer shall receive a refund of any prepaid fees for the period following the effective date of \ntermination for such terminated Services.   \n \nSalesforce Data Processing Addendum  Page 8 of 16 November 2023  \nonline  13.
