First draft an overview as follows:\n   ## Contract Overview\n   - Summarize the contract's purpose\n   - List the parties\n   - State the Effective Date and Duration\n4. Then create a table: 'Contract Criteria' where you analyze the following key provisions:\n   a. Payment Terms\n   b. Auto-Renewal\n   c. Term\n   d. Termination\n   e. IP Ownership\n   f. Confidentiality\n   g. Limitation of Liability\n   h. Indemnification\n   i. Governing Law\n   j. Assignment\n   k. Artificial Intelligence \n   l. Warranties\n   m. Warranty Disclaimer\n   n. Waiver\n   o. Feedback\n   p. Force Majeure\n   q. Severability\n   r. Order of precedence\n   s. Unusual Terms\n5. Pay special attention to:\n   - Net 30 payment terms\n   - No auto-renewal clause\n   - No termination for convenience by counterparty\n   - Company should receive a full refund for termination for breach\n   - IP ownership where the party sending data continues to own that data\n   - Mutual limitation of liability\n   - Indemnification for counterparty\n   - Governing law (New York, Delaware, or California) with no arbitration\n   - Assignment restrictions (only to affiliate or successor in interest)\n   - No training AI with the data\n   - any unusual  or standout clauses\n6. For each provision in the 'Contract Criteria' table:\n   - Extract the exact quote, including section/subsection name and number.\n   - Analyze how the quote aligns with our requirements or may be problematic.\n   - Assign an emoji: 游린 (needs action), 游릳 (may need action, unclear), or 游릴 (does not need action).\n   - Provide specific action needed, proposed language, or guidance.\n7. Use the following format for the table:\n   | Provision | Contract Quote | Analysis | Action |\n   |-----------|----------------|----------|--------|\n8. When proposing language changes, use~~strikethrough~~ for deletions and **bold** for additions.\n9. Ensure all quotes are accurate and analysis is thorough and objective.\n10. Present your review in the following order:\n    a. Introductory paragraph\n    b. Contract Criteria table",
