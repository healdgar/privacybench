        "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia’s fiery left-wing President Gustavo Petro is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuels on the world stage today, with speeches that lump oil and coal with cocaine as his country’s “three poisons.” He’s set a goal of weaning Colombia off those fossil fuels, putting the green energy transition and environmental protection at the center of his agenda.\n\nHis opposition is long-held, but it’s also practical. Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n"

He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

However, it also includes the criticism regarding the economic impact of these policies, which introduces a counter-argument emphasizing economic freedom and market-based solutions, slightly shifting the summary towards a more balanced perspective than a purely authoritarian viewpoint. This makes it slightly more libertarian-leaning than the original article, hence the rating of 6."

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis.

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels and aims to transition the country to green energy. With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

Overall, the summary remains relatively faithful to the source article's presentation of the controversy, but with a minor skew towards emphasizing the criticisms."

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts.

But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With limited oil reserves, Colombia is seeking international financial support to overcome the higher borrowing costs typically faced by developing nations for climate initiatives. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for fairer financial rules at COP29 to enable Colombia's shift away from fossil fuels. Colombia is promoting a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and launching investment portfolios to attract funding for sustainable projects. However, Petro's radical approach faces criticism, with some arguing that restricting oil production will hurt Colombia's revenue without significantly impacting global emissions.\n",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending.

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending.

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending. Colombia is seeking approximately $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation plans, including ecotourism and ecosystem conservation, but faces challenges in securing international financial backing for its transition away from fossil fuels.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nHere's a 5-sentence summary:\n\nColombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is actively opposing fossil fuels, aiming to transition the country away from oil and coal, which currently make up more than half of its exports. The urgency is driven by Colombia's limited oil reserves, projected to last only about seven years, but the transition faces significant challenges due to higher borrowing costs for developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad is advocating for better financial support from wealthy nations at the UN climate talks (COP29) in Azerbaijan, emphasizing that developing countries need fair access to capital for their green transition. While Petro has implemented measures like stopping new oil drilling contracts and promoting offshore wind power projects, critics argue this approach could sacrifice crucial fiscal revenue and public spending.

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

It mentions the $40 billion investment portfolio but doesn't specify what areas that investment would go to. It also lacks the direct quotes from Hare and Gonzalez, which add weight to their respective perspectives."

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees.

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is leading efforts to transition the country away from its dependence on fossil fuels, which constitute over half of its exports, despite criticism from opponents who argue it could hurt the economy. Colombia faces the challenge of transitioning to green energy with limited oil reserves and high borrowing costs, which are common among developing nations. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad highlighted Colombia's struggle for fair financial conditions at the COP29 climate talks, emphasizing the need for significant international investment. Critics, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, view Petro's approach as radical and warn of potential fiscal challenges due to decreased oil production. Nonetheless, Colombia continues to push for alternative energy solutions and international support for its green transition initiatives.",

With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies. Despite these challenges, Colombia is seeking $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation and renewable energy projects, but the lack of backing from the international financial community remains a major obstacle.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombia’s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is aggressively advocating for a transition away from fossil fuels, labeling oil, coal, and cocaine as the country’s “three poisons” and halting new oil drilling contracts and fracking. With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies.

Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies.

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombia’s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is aggressively advocating for a transition away from fossil fuels, labeling oil, coal, and cocaine as the country’s “three poisons” and halting new oil drilling contracts and fracking. With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies. Despite these challenges, Colombia is seeking $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation and renewable energy projects, but the lack of backing from the international financial community remains a major obstacle.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombia’s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is aggressively advocating for a transition away from fossil fuels, labeling oil, coal, and cocaine as the country’s “three poisons” and halting new oil drilling contracts and fracking. With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies.

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombia’s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is aggressively advocating for a transition away from fossil fuels, labeling oil, coal, and cocaine as the country’s “three poisons” and halting new oil drilling contracts and fracking. With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombia’s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is aggressively advocating for a transition away from fossil fuels, labeling oil, coal, and cocaine as the country’s “three poisons” and halting new oil drilling contracts and fracking. With Colombia’s oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro’s administration is pushing for renewable energy projects but faces significant financial and economic challenges, as fossil fuels account for over half of exports and 8% of GDP. Environment Minister Susana Muhamad has emphasized at COP29 that developing nations like Colombia face “unfair conditions” in accessing capital for the energy transition, calling for international financial support. Critics, including former Energy Minister Tomas Gonzalez, argue that Petro’s radical approach risks economic sacrifices without reducing global emissions, highlighting a disconnect between ambitious goals and practical policies. Despite these challenges, Colombia is seeking $40 billion in investments for climate adaptation and renewable energy projects, but the lack of backing from the international financial community remains a major obstacle.",

He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine.

At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude.

At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees.

At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions.

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions.

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a vocal critic of fossil fuels, aims to transition his country away from oil and coal, which he considers among the nation's \"three poisons\" alongside cocaine. Petro's push for a green energy shift is driven by the reality that Colombia's oil reserves are expected to last only about seven years, necessitating a move away from fossil fuels that constitute over half of its exports. At the COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad emphasized the financial challenges developing countries like Colombia face in transitioning to sustainable energy, calling for more supportive international financial rules. Petro has implemented policies such as halting new oil drilling contracts and banning fracking, but these moves have drawn criticism for potentially sacrificing national revenue without reducing global emissions. Despite these efforts, Colombia struggles to attract the necessary international investment for its climate adaptation plans, which aim to fund initiatives like ecotourism and ecosystem restoration, highlighting a disconnect between Petro's ambitious goals and the current policy actions.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy.

With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy.

However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts.

What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels, referring to oil and coal as \"poisons\" and aiming to transition his country to green energy. With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels, referring to oil and coal as \"poisons\" and aiming to transition his country to green energy. With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap.

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis.

It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels, referring to oil and coal as \"poisons\" and aiming to transition his country to green energy. With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",

It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil.

Colombia’s oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports.\n\nBut doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said.\n\nMuhamad has been highlighting Colombia’s challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year’s talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems.\n\nAt a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world “cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.”\n\nMuhamad also touted her country’s support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and managing a global transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“Oil is not a gift from god,” Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. “It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.”\n\n“We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,” she said. “But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.”\n\nDeveloping economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition.\n\nMuhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces “unfair conditions” in accessing capital.\n\nPetro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the “greedy” extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022.\n\nBut his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism.\n\nTomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro’s approach “very radical.”\n\n“As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,” Gonzalez said. “But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.”\n\nOil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It’s the world’s sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH.\n\n“We don’t have huge reserves,” Muhamad said. “We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.”\n\nColombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that “the opposite direction of what we need.”\n\nColombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems.\n\n“Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change.\n\n“They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.”\n\nHare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up.\n\n“They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,” he said. “It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.”\n\nFor Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place.\n\n“Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,” he said. “When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.”\n\n\nSummary:\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is a vocal opponent of fossil fuels, referring to oil and coal as \"poisons\" and aiming to transition his country to green energy. With Colombia's oil reserves projected to last only seven years, Petro's administration is seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which currently make up over half of its exports. However, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad notes that developing countries like Colombia face significant challenges in making this transition, including higher borrowing costs and limited access to capital. Muhamad is advocating for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels and calling for wealthy nations to provide more support to developing countries in their efforts to transition to renewable energy. Despite criticism from some quarters, including former energy minister Tomas Gonzalez, who calls Petro's approach \"very radical,\" climate scientists like Bill Hare praise Colombia's efforts to move away from fossil fuels, but emphasize the need for international financial support to make this transition successful.",
